## Agile Planning and Development Process

The development of HW|Blog followed an Agile methodology, utilizing a Kanban board hosted on GitHub to manage tasks and workflows. This approach made it easier to focus on immediate tasks while also keeping an eye on the broader project goals and progress.


### Kanban Board

[Link to the board](https://github.com/users/GKopanidis/projects/6)

The board was divided into three primary columns:

- **Todo:** Tasks that are planned but not yet in progress.
- **In Progress:** Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Done:** Tasks that have been completed.

Each task was created as an issue and then categorized into Epics and User Stories for better organization and focus.


### Epics and User Stories

Prior to starting development, Epics and User Stories were created to define the scope and goals of the project. This made it easier to break down the project into smaller, manageable chunks and helped in tracking progress effectively.

- **Epics**: Large areas of work that contain multiple tasks.
- **User Stories**: Smaller tasks that contribute to the completion of an Epic.

This Agile planning setup contributed significantly to the efficient and focused development of Loop
